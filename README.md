# DS / Ml projects

## Fermentation. 
Simulation of the fermentation process. The goal is to obtain a model capable of predicting the behavior of the fermenting substance over time. The data was provided by my colleague from a related university, two models were trained: linear regression and the recurrent neural network LSTM. 

## NER
The goal of the project is to learn how to use various tools for working with natural language. LSTM models were trained, as well as the word2vec model for vector representation of words.
